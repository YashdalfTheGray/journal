# May 20 2016 - Memoization

## Background

Memoization (as I understand it) is storing the past result of an operation like a function call and using that result in the next function call. This basically prevents the computer from having to go through the process again for the same inputs. A common use for a memoizer is the javascript `reduce()` function. It iterates over a collection, running each item through a formula and starting at an initial state, memoizing the results till it reaches the end of the collection.

To sum an array in Jvascript

```javascript
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].reduce((sum, n) => {
    return sum + n
}, 0);
```
