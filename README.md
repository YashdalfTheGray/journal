A journaling of things I learn to turn into a blog at some point

## Organization

The top level folders are for years, the next level down are for months and the next level down are for days. Each document contains stuff that I learned that day

The stuff that I write in these documents is mostly just stream of consciousness formatted so bear with me. I'm going to try and use this to improve my writing, technical and otherwise.
